William:
Game idea: A 2d exploring with horror elemnts. the main character falls into a vast cave system and only has a flashlight to fend off the creature lurking there. There will be different biomes such as an underwater biome or even an insect biome. Since the monsters live in the dark they are afraid of the light. the main characters goal is to leave the cave

loosly based off of Hollow knight and subnautica also if you have seen it or not The pitch black movie(2000)

Other Game idea : A 2d horror game based where you play as a sercurity gaurd for an apartment building. there you sit at your desk and have to let the residents in while keeping anything else out. to communicate with your residents trying to enter, you will recieve messages from them on your console about their i.d and other such as well as greetings. you can let them in or not by pressing the green or red button.

loosly based off of passports please, five knights at freddy's and doki doki literature club

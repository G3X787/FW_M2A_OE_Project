2D Horror explorer:
	- A Wicher-like system where you detect the supernatural with hightened senses
	- No combat (scarier when the player cant do anything against the enemy)
	- Puzzles to complete rooms and advance through the game/story

2D Horde/Bullet Hell:
	- Stance system to switch up abilities/spells
	- Different levels with bosses and unlockables
	- Big leveling system (big numbers make me happy)
	- Different classes?
